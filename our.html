    <h1>Brief History About Wizkid</h1>
    <p>
        Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun (born 16 July 1990), known professionally as Wizkid,[3] is a Nigerian singer and songwriter. A prominent figure in the modern-day Afrobeats music scene, Wizkid is regarded as one of the biggest and most influential African artists of all time.[4][5] He began recording music at the age of 11 and released a collaborative album with the Glorious Five (5), a group he and a couple of his church friends formed. In 2009, Wizkid signed a record deal with Banky W's Empire Mates Entertainment (E.M.E). He later rose to the limelight after releasing "Holla at Your Boy", the lead single from his debut studio album, Superstar (2011), which also spawned the singles "Tease Me/Bad Guys" and "Don't Dull".
    
    In September 2014, he released the self-titled second studio album, Ayo. The album was supported by six singles, including the song "Jaiye Jaiye". Wizkid left E.M.E. after his contract expired. In 2016, Wizkid achieved international recognition following his collaboration with Drake on the hit single "One Dance", which reached number-one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in 14 additional countries. The song broke multiple records, making Wizkid the first Afrobeats artist to appear in the Guinness World Records.[6] In March 2017, he signed a multi-album deal with RCA Records and released his third studio album Sounds from the Other Side, later that year. The album was supported by five singles, including "Come Closer" featuring Drake.
